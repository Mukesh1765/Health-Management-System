                        We are a team of young innovators passionate about
                        building accessible, reliable, and modern healthcare
                        solutions. Healthcare has traditionally been
                        complicated, fragmented, and difficult to navigate for
                        everyday people. Our mission is to change that by
                        bringing a seamless, mobile-first experience that
                        empowers everyone to manage their health effortlessly.
                        Through our platform, patients can book appointments,
                        access medical records, consult trusted doctors, and
                        order essential medicines—all from one simple, secure
                        interface. We believe quality healthcare should be
                        convenient, transparent, and available to every citizen,
                        not just a privileged few.
